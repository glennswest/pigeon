# Clay Pigeon Holder

Original Derived from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3399887

I wanted to see if I could convert this to a cnc based design. First I found I could not slice the original file,
as it seems to not be quite right. I used https://www.formware.co/onlinestlrepair to fix up the file.

Intent is to cut the two outer parts, and a inner part, and use cable ties to hold it togeather.
1/4 inch bolt to then attach to 2by4. I plan to use nylon, to reduce change of richocet.
